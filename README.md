## My process

1. Read the instructions of the challenge to take into account all the most important aspects.
2. Select framework or tools of your preference in this case I chose React.
3. Prepare the fonts and assets.
4. Build the structure of the elements only using HTML elements.
5. Name the elementÂ´s CSS classes using BEM convention.
6. After having a good structure then create the styles for each section.
7. Finish section by section, I chose to start doing the left-side section.
8. After finishing all in desktop version create media queries for mobile version.
9. To conclude I checked the styles in order to have the most accurate version of the challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

hsl and hsla properties allows us to add colors in a more flexible way

```css
div {
  background-color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%) /* hsl( hue, saturation%, lightness% )*/;
}

div {
  background-color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5) /* hsl( hue, saturation%, lightness%, Opacity )*/;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm aware that I need to study more core concepts of CSS and how to structure in a more efficient ways the HTML elements, even though I am able to build more complex apps this simple app helps me to undestand the things that I need to make a review.
